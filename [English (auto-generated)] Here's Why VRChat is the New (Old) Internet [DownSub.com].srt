00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,160
they eat the watermelon

5
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,840
why do they even do that

[Music]

7
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,360
at this point vr chat isn't really new

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
it's been out in one form or another

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,680
since

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,640
2014 although it didn't really start to

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
pick up steam until well

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,439
steam not that long after reaching the

13
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,040
platform it fell into the hands of some

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,840
streamers

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,799
soon after it exploded in popularity if

16
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,000
you don't currently play vr

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,520
chat but you've heard of it chances are

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,119
you've seen it a meme compilation or

19
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,479
something of the sorts

20
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,759
it has a mixed reputation

21
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,439
which is evident when you scan youtube

22
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,119
for a hot second

23
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,880
if you haven't heard of it explaining it

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
is pretty simple it's a virtual chat

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
room where most of the content is user

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,680
created

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,360
that means that the avatar's world's

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,119
experiences it's all created by the

29
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:47,680
users

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,159
so when you see cat girls wolf boys and

31
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,360
many many

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,680
many memes know that this wasn't

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,399
intentional

34
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
no one at vrchat wanted it to be this

35
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,600
way it just is

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,840
because that's what the community wants

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
despite the name however vrchat isn't

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,759
just for those with vr headsets it's

39
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,320
for anyone that can run it either on pc

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
or your headset of choice

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,239
while it's best experience in vr plenty

42
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,080
of people stick to desktop mode and

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
never really leave that i've known about

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,760
vr chat myself for years

45
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
it's been relatively popular in my group

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,800
of friends but

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,239
i just never got it i guess that was

48
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,840
until the entire world flipped on its

49
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,319
head

50
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,000
being locked inside can drive you a bit

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,760
fatty you can't see your friends

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
you can't see your family you can't see

53
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,920
anyone you also can't go anywhere

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,599
even if you're an introvert it feels

55
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,360
just suffocating

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840
to make a long story short my wife and i

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
started to spend a lot of time together

58
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,040
in vr chat

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,840
what started as just a way to kill time

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
in the middle of a pandemic

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,920
quickly became something more soon we

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,200
began to go on

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
dates to all kinds of exotic and

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,920
beautiful places

65
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,640
eventually she wanted to make us both

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,239
custom avatars

67
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,519
like they say when in rome i've stuck

68
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,760
just about 100 hours into vr chat now

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,159
which to be clear feels like nothing but

70
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,519
it is enough for me to feel very

71
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,000
strongly about one thing in particular

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
vr chat is magical

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
your avatar can look any way you want it

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,200
to

75
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,840
up to the limitations of your equipment

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
if you're ugly you can make your avatar

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,879
beautiful

78
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,879
if you've just gotten out of bed your

79
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720
avatar can still be wearing beautiful

80
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
clothes and professionally applied

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,360
makeup

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,000
you can look like a gorilla or a dragon

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,239
or a giant talking penis in the

84
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,519
metaverse

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,280
spend five minutes walking down the

86
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,200
street and you'll see all of these

87
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
so depending on what media you've been

88
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
exposed to you're probably going to have

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,959
a preconceived notion of what vr chat

90
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,519
actually

91
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,720
is a lot of anime avatars

92
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,640
miles and miles of them wait

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,760
in fact this doesn't really feel right

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,480
no one wants to watch a bald 30 year old

95
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,799
man

96
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,840
lecture them about vr chat let's change

97
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,319
this up

98
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,320
there we go now where were we

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,880
vr chat is a community-based social and

100
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,918
creativity hub

101
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,440
built in the vein of many of its

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,240
predecessors like habitat

103
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,919
worlds away active worlds their

104
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,880
or second life the idea is simply to

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,960
give people an environment to socialize

106
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
or create in and at the end of the day

107
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,600
that's basically it it's a socialization

108
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,000
engine

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,880
but an extremely stylish one a few of my

110
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,759
friends asked me

111
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,400
what the point is what is the objective

112
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,360
of vr chat

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,680
what kind of game is it and that's the

114
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,600
thing it really isn't a game

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
although there's certainly games within

116
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,280
it seriously people will straight up

117
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,600
recreate all sorts of games in vr chat

118
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
from rpgs to shooters to clones of other

119
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
vr hits

120
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,560
but the point of your chat is to just

121
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,639
kind of do whatever you want

122
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,039
so yeah you log in pick your avatar and

123
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,639
then you jump into one of a few hundred

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,440
worlds

125
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
most of which were created by the users

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,199
maybe you meet up with a friend and play

127
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,000
a card game

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,759
or maybe you decide to go to a virtual

129
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,919
nightclub maybe you meet some friends

130
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,919
maybe you just have a laugh sometimes

131
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,600
you'll just start up an hours long

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,880
conversation about

133
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,960
anything the game client allows you to

134
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,479
hop around virtual worlds pretty

135
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,440
seamlessly

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
the ui is intuitive and there's just not

137
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,039
that much of a learning curve

138
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,840
on the other hand the game itself is

139
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,160
questionably welcoming

140
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,520
this is a game that is just an

141
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,919
unparalleled mish mesh of creativity

142
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,600
anything you want to create with a few

143
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,120
limits can be here

144
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
there are so many worlds that are just

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
acid trips man

146
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,479
i have seen things i've seen so many

147
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,280
things

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
and the avatars can span everything from

149
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,039
sentient toilet paper to

150
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,000
as i've said already all sorts of anime

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
characters some original and

152
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,720
some not and all of that creativity goes

153
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,680
places

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,919
it's a chaotic mess it's at times a

155
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,280
performance nightmare

156
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
when you let anyone upload avatars and

157
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,120
worlds you're inevitably going to let in

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,080
a few things that

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,120
aren't exactly nice to be around

160
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,360
much like with that snow crash quote

161
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
avatars can basically be anything that

162
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,400
you want

163
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
if you can model it you can probably

164
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
bring it into vr chat

165
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,319
not all models are created equal though

166
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,319
and while some will perform smoothly

167
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,160
others will bring even the best gaming

168
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
pc to their knees

169
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,400
there are in-game safety settings you

170
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
can use to prevent

171
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
particularly resource intensive avatars

172
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,960
from loading but there are ways to

173
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,240
circumvent that system

174
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280
and that can lead to a bad time a few

175
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,759
times

176
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,520
i've gotten motion sick due to an

177
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,840
especially malevolent avatar

178
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,680
likewise i've been hit by waves of

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,599
screaming children and skyscraper tall

180
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,479
avatars

181
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,639
or swarms of people throwing dead memes

182
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,759
around and

183
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,280
new memes that make me just and

184
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,800
look i know it sounds like i'm

185
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,120
complaining but i think vr chat is truly

186
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,440
what vr was always supposed to be

187
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
when i first read snow crash and was

188
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
introduced to the metaverse as a kid

189
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,120
vr chat is exactly what i was

190
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
envisioning in my head

191
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,680
i've always been obsessed with virtual

192
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
reality it's

193
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,319
always just been something i've been

194
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,680
fascinated by sometime in 1996

195
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,960
or 1995 i can't remember my parents

196
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,479
bought me a virtual boy

197
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,639
at the time they'd been discontinued so

198
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,560
they were fairly cheap i remember seeing

199
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,319
it sitting on the end cap of a long gone

200
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,120
toy store

201
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,680
i only had two games and it was complete

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
garbage but it got my imagination going

203
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,199
like nothing else

204
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,520
as a kid i had to stay home from school

205
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,560
sick quite a bit

206
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
as well i didn't know it at the time my

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,800
immune system wasn't a big fan of my

208
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,520
intestines that means i spent a lot of

209
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:49,919
time

210
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,400
on the then developing pre-com boom

211
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,039
internet

212
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,520
that meant geocities and lots of chat

213
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,240
rooms

214
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
eventually one day someone suggested to

215
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
me what is in my mind anyway

216
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
the real predecessor to vr chat active

217
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
worlds active worlds is a 3d chat

218
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,680
program launched in 1995 as an

219
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
offshoot of another project by worldsync

220
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
who'd previously developed another

221
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,080
semi-3d

222
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
chat program called worlds chat

223
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
eventually active worlds would spin off

224
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
into its own company due to internal

225
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
interest issues

226
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,199
that's probably a good thing as their

227
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,639
parent company became

228
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,960
known as notorious patent trolls active

229
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,000
world's big difference

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
was that whereas worlds chat was all

231
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,360
built by developers

232
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,840
active worlds was built by users this

233
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,360
building was done by moving around

234
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,479
in-game objects

235
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,440
it would be a stretch to call this

236
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,679
proto-unity

237
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,919
but it works in a very similar way you

238
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
use shapes put textures on those shapes

239
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
and then move them into place

240
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,519
there's a rudimentary scripting language

241
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,200
to modify objects with in a variety of

242
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,080
ways too

243
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
active worlds was basically built like a

244
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,839
web browser you'd spawn in a gateway

245
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,600
that was basically just a general chat

246
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,800
room through the ui

247
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,480
you could teleport to different worlds

248
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,839
some of these worlds were hosted by

249
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
individual people on their own servers

250
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
others however were referred to as

251
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,760
public worlds one of these public worlds

252
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,240
alpha world was the largest and usually

253
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
the most populated with a few hundred

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,080
users at any given time these particular

255
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
worlds were hosted by

256
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,279
active worlds themselves and were

257
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,800
basically just free-for-alls

258
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,560
in alpha world anyone could make

259
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,399
buildings this led to the world being

260
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:18,880
filled

261
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,120
by all kinds of creations some

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,279
incredible some not so incredible

263
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,279
the big draw at back to worlds was that

264
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,720
you could quite literally

265
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,560
build communities people would come to

266
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,080
this program to make friends and build

267
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,560
things

268
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,519
often at the same time it was genuinely

269
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,240
really cool

270
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,399
and way ahead of its time there are

271
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,519
whole cities here

272
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,760
built by communities that formed in this

273
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,800
world and

274
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,360
when i say cities i don't mean that you

275
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,320
click a button and

276
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,800
a city pops out or there's some kind of

277
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,959
system for setting one up there isn't

278
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,360
someone just decided one day i want to

279
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,240
build a city

280
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,320
the developers never intended for this

281
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
to happen it was never encouraged or

282
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,640
forced

283
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,600
someone just wheeled it into being but

284
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,279
active worlds hasn't really stood the

285
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,160
test of time

286
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,399
it's clunky it doesn't perform well and

287
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,000
while many of the in-game creations

288
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
still hold up

289
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,560
it doesn't look good it's also abandoned

290
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,880
the company behind aw has a pretty

291
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,000
tumultuous history

292
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
and i'm not gonna go into it here it was

293
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,839
also limited by the technology of the

294
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,240
time

295
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,839
you could always tell that there was

296
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,440
more that they wanted to do

297
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,279
but they just couldn't afford to add

298
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,200
features at the time though

299
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
active worlds was the coolest thing i

300
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,680
met people from all over the world i

301
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,440
created things joined and built

302
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,240
communities myself i was part of a city

303
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,320
i lived an entire life here one where i

304
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
could escape how shitty my body

305
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,519
constantly felt as a kid

306
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,800
for a very large part of my

307
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
developmental years my creativity ran

308
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
wild in this place

309
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,760
everything about aw is a relic of its

310
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,240
time

311
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
the way the game works the things that

312
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
were created even what the default

313
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,120
avatars look like

314
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
and the fact that they're called avatars

315
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,120
in the first place all of this harkens

316
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,440
back

317
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,920
to a different age and honestly it's an

318
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,440
age that i miss

319
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,680
see while active worlds came out way too

320
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,200
early to be vr

321
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
i felt that it truly got with virtual

322
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,880
reality where the metaverse

323
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
was always supposed to be i've

324
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,800
referenced snow crash and its metaverse

325
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,160
a few times so far

326
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,839
and i realize that not everyone is

327
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,600
familiar with that particular novel

328
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,760
so for starters snow crash is a novel

329
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
that came out in 1992 written by neil

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,720
stephenson

331
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,399
it's one of those books that's hugely

332
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,240
influential on the internet

333
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,480
virtual reality and just technology in

334
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,160
general in snow crash

335
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
stevenson built basically two separate

336
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,560
worlds first there was reality

337
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,640
reality in snow crash is a cyberpunk

338
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,480
capitalist nightmare where the us has

339
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,320
collapsed and has been subsumed by

340
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,839
numerous corporate entities

341
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,000
then there's the metaverse the metaverse

342
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
is a virtual reality plane you log into

343
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
a future internet built by hackers and

344
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,440
artists it's still

345
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,360
very much influenced by the real world

346
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,639
but there's a sense that all the

347
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,079
creativity and community

348
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,480
that is perpetually denied in reality

349
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
actually has a place there

350
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,279
but the metaverse isn't smooth it's not

351
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,519
a flawless polished experience

352
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,079
it's noisy and loud with planes crashing

353
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,040
on the street

354
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,600
and as mentioned above giant penises

355
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,440
walking around next to meticulously

356
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,880
crafted avatars

357
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,639
sure the corporate trappings are still

358
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,279
present but they don't run the place

359
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
that's kind of the whole point cyberpunk

360
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,040
is often described as

361
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,279
high tech low life and i feel like a

362
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,760
mishmash of art next to absolute havoc

363
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,560
is really on point that really captured

364
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
something about the early internet

365
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,320
sandwiched between the yuppie runaway

366
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
capitalism of the 80s

367
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
and the hopefulness and technophilia of

368
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,519
the 90s

369
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,680
a lot of cyberpunk literature reflects

370
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,560
that and

371
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,079
i think it's really telling that the

372
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,160
same corpus is constantly referenced in

373
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,720
virtual reality games or in aws case

374
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,600
proto-vr games snow crash was very much

375
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,480
cyberpunk

376
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,720
technically post cyberpunk go away

377
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,160
english degree

378
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
neil stephenson was clearly looking at

379
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
the then 90s internet as a place of both

380
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,639
potential

381
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,279
and well giant corporations taking

382
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,320
everything over

383
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
even though that hadn't happened quite

384
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,320
yet but heavy on the potential

385
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,399
was really the important bit there

386
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,639
oftentimes the point of cyberpunk gets

387
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,240
lost in modern media

388
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,519
take cyberpunk 2077 for example while we

389
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,360
don't really know what it's like yet

390
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,120
a lot of what the developers have said

391
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,200
reflect that whole high-tech low-life

392
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,839
maxim

393
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,440
without really seeming to understand

394
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
that the comma in that phrase is a

395
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,240
critique

396
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,120
i think that stay dead you can't hurt me

397
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,040
anymore

398
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,320
active worlds was the perfect

399
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,560
representation of the metaverse and it's

400
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,639
no wonder the team that built active

401
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,399
worlds was certainly inspired by the

402
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:38,800
book

403
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
and not just the book but the sort of

404
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,000
ethos that was behind it

405
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,240
there's always this sort of cynicism

406
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,000
present within a lot of new technology

407
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,320
that just doesn't feel present in aw

408
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,560
or at least didn't at the time there's

409
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,240
always the secret hand that's trying to

410
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,480
monetize in the most aggressive way

411
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,240
even if that means functionally changing

412
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,000
what makes something special

413
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,920
active worlds was devoid of that in many

414
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,160
ways it seemed like it was a project in

415
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,199
building something cool

416
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,120
and just seeing what players did with it

417
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,720
essentially it was an experiment in

418
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
building the metaverse and just seeing

419
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,600
what would happen

420
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,279
but the virtual communities that came

421
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,199
after their and second life

422
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,399
specifically always seemed not

423
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,639
that while second life developed a

424
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,519
reputation

425
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,800
there was always something more

426
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,120
streamlined more polished more corporate

427
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,320
about that particular app

428
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,560
that kept me away from it whereas active

429
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,440
worlds was a mess

430
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,360
second life was streamlined and built

431
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,199
more like a pre-social network than

432
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,079
anything else

433
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,760
in active worlds you had to find and

434
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,279
build a community in the most

435
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,399
jankiest obtuse way possible in second

436
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,600
life by comparison

437
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,120
they kind of rolled out the red carpet

438
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
for you that same thing can be said with

439
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,279
their

440
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,240
which was an absolute abomination a

441
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,839
corporate fever dream that saw what was

442
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,120
happening in virtual worlds

443
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
and said someone in a boardroom go hey

444
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,519
what if we sold this to mtv

445
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,360
really what was going on with virtual

446
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,800
worlds was the same thing that was

447
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,560
happening with the internet at large

448
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,880
it was changing while it arguably was

449
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
becoming more useful

450
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,800
it was also becoming more boxed in there

451
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320
was a certain playfulness

452
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,240
along with a strong sense of community

453
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,839
that just seemed to be lost

454
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,680
all right zoomers old man straz is here

455
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,839
to tell you about the good old days

456
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,160
get on your swim trunks because we're

457
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
about to surf the net

458
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,320
get in your lanyard and slap on your

459
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
driving gloves because it's time to

460
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,279
cruise the world wide web

461
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,720
no but seriously the internet in 2020

462
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,639
is a wonderful thing i'm not going to

463
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,839
pretend like it isn't

464
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,920
the sheer amount of information the ease

465
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,759
at which you can access it and the tools

466
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,199
available at our fingertips

467
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,079
are bizarre and wonderful we're living

468
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:52,959
in the future

469
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,600
baby we're also right in the middle of

470
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,360
the apocalypse and the modern internet

471
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,839
lets us

472
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,279
basically order anything we want

473
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
straight to our doors

474
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
the internet is without a doubt easier

475
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,279
to use more straightforward

476
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,759
more useful and more prominent than it

477
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,519
ever has been in the past

478
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,800
this is an obvious statement to be blunt

479
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
but i feel like it's necessary to make

480
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
before i say the next thing

481
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,199
in the famous words of grammy award

482
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,800
winner rob thomas

483
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,720
man it's a hot one the internet is

484
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,720
also really really bad at one time

485
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,880
not that long ago the internet just

486
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,480
didn't look like the internet we know

487
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,279
and love

488
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,279
at one time the internet wasn't the

489
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,720
fabric holding together your social

490
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
circle nor was it the thing ensuring

491
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
your food got there on time

492
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,199
that might seem bad but it also wasn't

493
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,120
something that manipulated our thoughts

494
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,279
constantly sold us things harvested our

495
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,480
data willy-nilly

496
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
let elon musk say anything

497
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,440
invaded our lives with countless

498
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
algorithms or just a billion other

499
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,880
really crimey scummy things

500
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
comparing the modern internet to the

501
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,560
internet of the past is a bit like

502
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,799
comparing a main street in most towns 20

503
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,679
years ago

504
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,559
to main street today there's tactically

505
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,760
more stuff there now

506
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,640
probably and it's probably more useful

507
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:12,959
but

508
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,599
a lot of the charm and uniqueness that

509
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,559
made it special

510
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,959
just isn't there anymore the modern

511
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,760
internet is a

512
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,559
giant funko pop it's a miserable twisted

513
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,720
corporate simulacrum of ideas

514
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
conjured up into plastic nonsense that

515
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,640
you can collect and tag

516
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,919
it's miserable cynical a year ago i

517
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,000
bookmarked a comment on reddit that i

518
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,039
liked just so much the randomness of the

519
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,080
old internet

520
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,760
it felt like it was truly run by the

521
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
people now it feels super

522
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,559
corporate and designed everything is

523
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,520
planned

524
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
we're like two minutes into this section

525
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,120
and i realize i'm being pretty vague

526
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,799
so let me say that when i say early

527
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,960
internet i specifically mean the decade

528
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
from about 94 to 2004.

529
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,880
this is the period that the internet

530
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,640
really started to evolve from something

531
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,360
academic

532
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,000
to well whatever people wanted to do

533
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,559
with it

534
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,240
this meant early venture capitalist

535
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,400
failures in the dot-com boom but it also

536
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,360
meant fan sites

537
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
early forms springing up from the corpse

538
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,679
of bulletin board systems or bbs's

539
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,840
and an unstopped wave of creativity and

540
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,880
community building

541
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,799
there weren't any real expectations for

542
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,640
what you could or should create

543
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,880
it was just a blank slate but the thing

544
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,400
is for a long time

545
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,320
the internet wasn't really user friendly

546
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,160
and that meant that people

547
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,320
not necessarily corporations were the

548
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
ones to fill in the gaps

549
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,080
you'd have bookmarks did people even use

550
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,200
those anymore like

551
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
like thousands of bookmarks to just

552
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,720
random individual sites that people

553
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
built in their basement to help you do

554
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
random things college professors used to

555
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
maintain sites on their individual

556
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,120
interests

557
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,280
and those were usually the best places

558
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,320
for information

559
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,760
like if you enjoyed a tv show or a video

560
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,600
game you'd go to a website for that

561
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,400
video game

562
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
and that's where everything was and

563
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,840
there were like 10 other websites just

564
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,480
like that

565
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
and they'd all link to each other and

566
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,679
they'd have these little buttons you'd

567
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,520
click on to get to the other sites there

568
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,799
are web rings you

569
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,559
don't even use a search engine you would

570
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,160
just find a web ring portal

571
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,679
which was a bunch of sites that were

572
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,360
linked together and you would click

573
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,880
around it was novel

574
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,039
it wasn't efficient but as you jumped

575
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,000
from site to site

576
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
there was a distinct sense of

577
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,039
personality you

578
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
really would surf the web you would

579
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,440
really discover new places and things

580
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,840
and

581
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,160
people and there was no algorithm or

582
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,760
anything doing it for you

583
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,160
you were doing that work today the

584
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,600
internet isn't really a thing you

585
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,320
explore

586
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,200
it's just a delivery system it's a way

587
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,440
for us to get to our apps or websites

588
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,480
that might as well

589
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,360
just be abs i'm not excluding myself

590
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,480
here either

591
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,120
most days i don't really explore the

592
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,919
internet

593
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,600
the internet is just the thing that

594
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,679
gives me access to reddit or twitter or

595
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,559
gmail

596
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,720
i can't honestly remember the last time

597
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,360
i visited someone's personal website

598
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,400
like zoomers if if you're still there

599
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,799
did did you know that people can just

600
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,080
have websites that they

601
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,360
used to just have websites just like

602
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,080
websites for stuff not portfolios or

603
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,360
pictures of their cat

604
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,080
just like stuff you'd find but all of

605
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,760
that over the last two decades

606
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,480
has been transformed giant corporate

607
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,320
overlords have soaked up basically

608
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,880
all of the internet for better or worse

609
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
google for example vacuumed up so much

610
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,840
of the search space

611
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,520
that there basically aren't any other

612
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,280
search engines that matter

613
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,039
that control fundamentally means that

614
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,039
they dictate how the internet works and

615
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,720
what succeeds and what doesn't

616
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,360
their algorithm determines what you see

617
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,000
this is true

618
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,080
for every website that houses user

619
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,320
created content of any kind

620
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
the algorithm theoretically directs

621
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,000
people to what they want to see

622
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,240
but more accurately it directs them to

623
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,400
content that keeps them engaged on the

624
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,039
platform

625
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,039
so they have more of a chance to see the

626
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,159
advertisements

627
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,240
that's why youtube likes long content

628
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,000
you're more likely to stick around for

629
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,520
advertisements if you're on one

630
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,960
continuous video

631
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,840
but of course the content has to also be

632
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,440
advertiser friendly

633
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
if it isn't you'll need an alternative

634
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
source of revenue

635
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,240
and while it's great that many channels

636
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,600
have been able to do that

637
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
there's no doubt that this molds what

638
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,720
content is on the platform

639
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,679
for every h bomber guy or tentacruel

640
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,039
there are a thousand

641
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,919
garbage top 10 channels or life hacks or

642
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,120
unboxings or

643
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
whatever just because the algorithm eats

644
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,480
that stuff up

645
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,840
i mean christ i i go on youtube to get

646
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,080
away from churned out corporate media

647
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,159
and now i'm being served recommendations

648
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,919
for jimmy kimmel

649
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,760
i'm not saying that everything created

650
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,440
today on youtube is bad

651
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,400
far from it but what it is in almost

652
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,200
every case

653
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
is creativity that's been boxed in by

654
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,360
exactly what a specific corporate

655
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,720
overlord wants

656
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,039
and while creativity can live within

657
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,919
closed off

658
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,320
walled in spaces and maybe even that

659
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,679
strict form can produce

660
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,400
really great art it's still limiting in

661
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
a way that's just

662
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,760
chafed against me that i just didn't

663
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,720
realize until

664
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,120
fairly recently to put it another way

665
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,679
the introduction of web 2.0 was supposed

666
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,520
to usher in a new age of

667
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,440
community-based websites and

668
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
user-created content

669
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,159
and for a short period of time it did in

670
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,400
the early 2000s you saw the growth of

671
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,600
sites like newgrounds deviantart ytm d

672
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,039
and even dig yet not that long after

673
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,280
social media took over and as the

674
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,240
dot-com boom

675
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,480
faded in the mirror dollar signs once

676
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,799
again appeared in investors eyes

677
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,360
internet mainstays died replaced by new

678
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,480
corporate behemoths

679
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,720
who were restructuring the web to suit

680
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,600
their margins

681
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
while there were brief moments of the

682
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,039
older internet living on in these

683
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:39,760
formats

684
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,840
once again like myspace and even the

685
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,799
older live journal

686
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,200
xanga and whatnot they were quickly

687
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,480
crowded out

688
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,960
hell even the bits of absurdist

689
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,000
creativity that

690
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,880
somehow appeared on social media quickly

691
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,799
turned into

692
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,080
this there are likely to be

693
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,320
people yelling at their screen now that

694
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,159
this is just what people wanted

695
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,200
no one forced facebook on them but

696
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,919
i'm really not so sure it's hard to

697
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,440
teleport back to that time

698
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,760
but what these technologies promised at

699
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,640
the time

700
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,360
and what they became are really not the

701
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,480
same thing

702
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,799
likewise even implying that users really

703
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,640
have genuine agency

704
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,760
in this sort of thing is

705
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,919
that's for another video but is someone

706
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,520
that works in marketing

707
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,559
and sees how the sausage is made yeah

708
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,039
no there's obviously a nostalgia for

709
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,640
this particular era for

710
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,720
folks my age being that we are

711
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,360
millennials

712
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,919
but i don't think that it was just all

713
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:42,960
nostalgia

714
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,320
i was a huge nerd surprise in high

715
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,039
school

716
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,000
and i'd always have kids asking me to

717
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,919
help them make their own website

718
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,159
it wasn't because they wanted to be rich

719
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,919
they just wanted a place to put their

720
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,200
music or art or

721
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,679
inside jokes or whatever on the flip

722
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,679
side i have a cousin who asked me

723
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,240
how to go about monetizing his music and

724
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,440
youtube channel

725
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,960
he's like 13. there's a certain way he

726
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,080
looks at the internet

727
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,480
as a tool a business object that i

728
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,440
totally get

729
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,279
but also god that's horribly depressing

730
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,159
for us for those of us that saw the 90s

731
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,760
and early 2000s internet

732
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,840
it just was something totally different

733
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,600
it meant something different

734
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,480
the old internet was a wild west of

735
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,120
wonky

736
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,919
half-baked design and novices barely

737
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,880
scraping together

738
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,480
snippets of html and css and php

739
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,360
and like photoshop skill but probably

740
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,919
more accurately paint shop pro skill

741
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,240
it was a mess crafted from paper mache

742
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,360
and dreams but

743
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
it was beautiful and representative of a

744
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,799
different time

745
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,840
when you found a tacky website you knew

746
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,799
it was that way

747
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,200
because someone wanted it that way it

748
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,720
was intentional

749
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,360
the disheveled mess of the

750
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,240
pre-dot-com-era internet was

751
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,480
really bad in a lot of ways but it was

752
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
also just so

753
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,679
full of possibility and while i've said

754
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,799
and will continue to say

755
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,880
creativity about a hundred thousand

756
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,200
times it was also about community

757
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,000
active worlds was in many ways perfectly

758
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,880
representative

759
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,520
of that time i think virtual reality and

760
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
the sense of stuff like the metaverse

761
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,480
and snow crash

762
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,880
was specifically born out of the chaotic

763
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,279
mess the internet was in its early era

764
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,760
other programs sanitized it much in the

765
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,440
same way that the internet itself was

766
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,120
changed in the mid-2000s

767
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,960
active worlds represented that perfectly

768
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,200
though even though it wasn't technically

769
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
virtual reality it was the metaverse

770
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,760
just before the technology had a chance

771
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,159
to

772
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,799
really get the full way there it was a

773
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,279
creative playground a massive community

774
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:45,840
and just

775
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,159
a space where you could make anything or

776
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,120
be anything

777
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,200
just because you wanted to it was

778
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,480
genuinely beautiful

779
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,320
and up until recently i thought that

780
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,600
that particular vision

781
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,440
wasn't something i'd ever find again

782
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,880
vr chat isn't something that i

783
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,960
immediately fell in love with in fact

784
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,360
vrchat sat installed on my computer from

785
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,520
way back when i got my first vr headset

786
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,640
the htc vive i i just didn't get it at

787
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,120
first

788
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
i walked around wondered what the fuss

789
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,360
was about and then logged right off

790
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
why would i want to talk to random

791
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,400
people on the internet

792
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,200
what is there even to see here now a

793
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,080
quick aside

794
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,640
i think my initial reaction is due to my

795
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,760
own internal

796
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,320
two-point owing well i've always been

797
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,200
into these

798
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
creative sort of games or whatever you

799
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,240
want to call them i'm

800
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,640
also a very competitive person i played

801
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,880
a lot of counter-strike wow arena

802
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,760
overwatch here's the storm and so on for

803
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,039
a long time my default

804
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,360
gaming attitude has basically just been

805
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,080
to compete

806
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,320
but when you're 31 and your reaction

807
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,679
speed is starting to slow

808
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,279
you can either deal with it by

809
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,120
gracefully ducking out and admitting

810
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,080
your limitations

811
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,840
find a way to improve your game sense to

812
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,200
compensate or just

813
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,559
internally continue to think you're a

814
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,480
god and instead hide within a virtual

815
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,240
reality filled with cat girls

816
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,480
considering i've been locked in my house

817
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,559
for the last uh 20

818
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,200
000 years or so at this point i i needed

819
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,799
to get out somehow i

820
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,360
just needed to not look at my walls

821
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,080
anymore

822
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,559
it was much the same for my wife and one

823
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,120
day we

824
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,600
just decided to give vr chat another try

825
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,320
and

826
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,799
this time it felt different my second

827
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,559
go-around had me spending some time

828
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,840
interacting with the world

829
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,320
and all the people in it i spent a lot

830
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,080
of time in public worlds which meant

831
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,760
that i was interacting with a pretty

832
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,000
large cross-section of the game's player

833
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,320
base every time i'd take off my headset

834
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,919
i'd look at my wife and just think

835
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,279
holy [ __ ] this is magical yet i couldn't

836
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,960
really put my finger on why

837
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
was it just the social interactions was

838
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
it just the people i was meeting

839
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,120
i mean yeah of course but there was

840
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,320
something more to it

841
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,880
i've interacted and been in hundreds of

842
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,720
online communities over the years

843
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,799
what was different here what was

844
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,760
different about

845
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,399
vr chat part of it was yeah the the

846
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,440
people the community

847
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,600
there's no algorithm directing me to a

848
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,520
lobby there's no decision making going

849
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,640
on beyond my own

850
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,880
oh this world looks neat when you click

851
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,679
and there you are

852
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,600
right there's nothing else to it the end

853
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,440
result was that i've met people from

854
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,679
many many countries my friends list is

855
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,880
ludicrously diverse

856
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
i met people in italy the netherlands

857
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
spain france germany russia

858
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,440
saudi arabia the philippines korea japan

859
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,919
and

860
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,000
many many more i've had long

861
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,200
conversations about

862
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,080
politics religion video games anime the

863
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,559
weather

864
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,559
memes the nature of consciousness poop

865
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,679
knives music

866
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,559
performing i i've had so many just good

867
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,679
conversations

868
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,799
and as an aside i've missed that how had

869
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,919
i forgotten that i

870
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,760
enjoyed this that i used to love this

871
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,159
thing but in the web 2.0 era

872
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,960
that was eradicated sure facebook groups

873
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,440
exist

874
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
twitter can theoretically connect you

875
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,799
with other people and read it

876
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,880
but these services are built to put like

877
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,640
with like the realities of that sort of

878
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,520
thing have been

879
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,960
think piece to death typically in

880
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,640
regards to stuff like politics

881
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,120
but i kind of want to build beyond that

882
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,559
and maybe less seriously

883
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,720
like i just think outside of how that's

884
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,840
damaged the world

885
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,159
it's also just ruined this quaint little

886
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:10,960
experience

887
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,279
the experience of meeting random people

888
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,880
and just talking with them

889
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
and to be clear this wasn't something

890
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,360
that just changed over time or was

891
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,559
accidentally broken

892
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,880
it was done on purpose the climate on

893
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,399
social media isn't a bug

894
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,880
it's a feature and once again this is a

895
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,039
topic way too complex to go on a tangent

896
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:29,600
on and

897
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,320
i've done too many of those already but

898
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,000
yeah the way social media encourages

899
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,120
both division and

900
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,520
like meeting like is not accidental and

901
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,840
it has undoubtedly made the internet a

902
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,640
worse place

903
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,520
but vr chat isn't just the people it's

904
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
also about the things they create

905
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,760
and vr chat is full of beautiful

906
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,120
incredible things

907
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,799
some of the worlds people have created

908
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,039
in vr chat are utterly breathtaking

909
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,480
what people are able to do on this

910
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,279
platform is amazing and the thing is

911
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,880
you're probably watching this right now

912
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,640
on a 2d screen and it's

913
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,559
probably still gorgeous to you now

914
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,080
consider that these are virtual

915
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
realities that you can go and explore

916
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
and interact with it's

917
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,919
really just something else i've probably

918
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,679
played every major vr release on the

919
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,039
market at this point and while there are

920
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,640
plenty of games that deliver memorable

921
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,440
experiences

922
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,360
none do it with the rapid-fire intensity

923
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,640
that vr chat does

924
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,559
i think five or ten years from now many

925
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,240
of the people building hobby creations

926
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,919
in vrchat are going to be working at

927
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,120
major studios or

928
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,039
winning awards somewhere and yes

929
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,559
galleries of beautiful things exist

930
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,200
elsewhere

931
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,679
but just not quite like this and the

932
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,600
creativity isn't just in the creation of

933
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,399
worlds it's

934
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,720
also in the avatars themselves there are

935
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,159
so many that are so neat

936
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,720
there's like an entire virtual fashion

937
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,559
in vr chat and trends and

938
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,960
people who push those things really hard

939
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,120
and then there's the things people do

940
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
with those worlds and avatars i've

941
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,760
watched someone dj a psytrance set in vr

942
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,520
i've watched dancing genuinely

943
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,360
impressive dancing i even met a

944
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
choreographer in vrchat that took pride

945
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,720
in making routines within virtual

946
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,360
reality

947
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,240
i've had a two foot tall anime boy in a

948
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,880
onesie

949
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,279
pajama thing perform an improv dance

950
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,559
routine in front of me

951
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,039
using his custom avatar a lot of these

952
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:09,600
things

953
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,760
are often broken and messy and they

954
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
glitch out and they aren't always there

955
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,000
they require digging and seeing a lot of

956
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,919
objectively strange and unsettling

957
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,279
things but the thing is

958
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,760
you see people's work too you see the

959
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,799
learning process

960
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,039
you see the janky worlds and the broken

961
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,880
avatars some of which glitch out in

962
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,159
hysterical ways

963
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,519
all this would have been blocked off

964
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,880
somewhere else all of this would have

965
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,200
been

966
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,679
just swept out into a bin it would have

967
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,640
been polished and

968
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
optimized it would have been flattened

969
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,399
and streamlined but not here

970
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,039
it's a paradise of high effort [ __ ]

971
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,000
posts

972
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,080
i've taken a ride on a hot dog with

973
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,760
glitched out clipping music screaming in

974
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,519
the background i've had a stick of

975
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,679
butter give me a lap dance it's

976
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,880
insanity actual insanity and there's no

977
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,720
other place like this on the internet

978
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,559
there's no place like this period

979
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,200
anymore

980
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,320
and look i know i know creative places

981
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,039
exist creativity is all over the

982
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,120
internet but these days even creativity

983
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,799
seems organized and structured

984
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,880
treated to the same algorithmic soup

985
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,640
that runs the rest of the internet

986
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,360
i don't want deviantart i want the old

987
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,679
deviantart give me the messy form give

988
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,440
me the disorganized gallery

989
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,600
the old internet was like this active

990
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,720
worlds was like this

991
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,799
there was no real sense to it and

992
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,399
there's still art there

993
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,080
that's long been buried into digital

994
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,320
sand the entropy of failed hard drives

995
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,480
likely killing many a creation before

996
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,000
they were seen by anyone

997
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,919
there are thousands of worlds i'll never

998
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,840
visit all of them and maybe to some

999
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,960
that's a tragedy

1000
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,559
maybe there should be some sort of

1001
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,559
algorithm that shows me the ones that

1002
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:40,799
are

1003
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,519
most organized most optimized cleanest

1004
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,640
and most artistic

1005
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,799
but i don't want that i want the

1006
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,880
postmodern chaotic soup that

1007
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,720
birthed the impossible to explain

1008
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,880
websites and wonderfully bizarre

1009
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,000
creations like

1010
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,960
why tmnd that primordial soup is what

1011
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,559
created the soul of the internet

1012
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,720
and for so long it's been banished in

1013
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,200
favor of one-page websites and

1014
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,919
endless software-as-a-service clones but

1015
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,000
vrchat brings the mess back

1016
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,880
i'm sure that seems like a backhanded

1017
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,679
compliment

1018
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,080
but it isn't hundreds of applications

1019
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,039
and games and

1020
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,760
relaunches of games have tried so hard

1021
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,360
to recapture what made that era

1022
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,919
wonderful

1023
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,159
the community of it the sense of awe and

1024
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,559
wonder the genuine feeling of logging in

1025
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,080
and not knowing what you'll find today

1026
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,840
of who you'll meet of what you'll see of

1027
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,120
what memories you'll make

1028
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,840
there's no psychological tooling at play

1029
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,600
there's no skinner's box there's no

1030
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,399
algorithm

1031
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,159
this this right here is what was lost

1032
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,919
earlier i mentioned that the current

1033
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,080
internet is just a delivery service

1034
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,640
well the old one was too but it's what

1035
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,080
it's delivering you to

1036
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,000
that's the difference the old internet

1037
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,080
was a playground of endless possibility

1038
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,880
and yes

1039
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,559
obviously people were trying to make

1040
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,399
money on it and it was commodified and

1041
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,480
sliced up by corporations then too

1042
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,159
but there was at least the illusion of

1043
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,159
choice of creative freedom the new

1044
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,159
internet is built to be a frictionless

1045
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:02,960
experience

1046
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,279
it's designed in every way to monetize

1047
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,360
every click every movement of your mouse

1048
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,280
virtually the last two or even three

1049
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,599
decades have been entirely defined by

1050
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,719
the simple question

1051
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,960
how can we possibly squeeze more money

1052
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,399
out of this internet thing

1053
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,280
and that's led to so many issues so many

1054
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,079
deep problems

1055
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,199
that'll take god generations to solve it

1056
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,399
makes me feel silly

1057
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,320
complaining about losing the old

1058
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,599
internet or whatever

1059
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,679
and yet as silly as it might be logging

1060
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,760
into vrchat makes me feel excited in a

1061
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,359
way that i have it in years

1062
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,760
vrchat is magical because of that it

1063
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,679
gets me excited about the internet again

1064
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,918
it successfully fools me if just for

1065
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,280
this moment in history

1066
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,320
this time freezing quarantine that yes

1067
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
the internet is a wonderful place full

1068
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,599
of possibility and

1069
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,440
i know practically it's never been

1070
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,520
easier to be creative on the internet

1071
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,879
than this moment in time

1072
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,719
but that creativity always seems like

1073
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,560
it's designed to go somewhere

1074
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,680
to lead to a job or monetization somehow

1075
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,599
and i know i even mentioned future

1076
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,800
developers earlier

1077
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,040
but that was more of a nod to the talent

1078
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,400
of people on this platform

1079
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,640
than anything else everyone playing this

1080
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,560
game who wants to create an avatar or

1081
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,960
world has to pick up unity and blender

1082
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,119
and learn a whole set of skills that is

1083
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,640
practically useless to them

1084
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,880
but it means that they can create an ad

1085
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,680
to this world

1086
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,200
that they can show off to friends that

1087
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,040
they can build communities that are

1088
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,400
absurd anywhere else and the thing is i

1089
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,079
know i'm not the only one who feels this

1090
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,000
way i've seen the general thought of

1091
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,320
vr chat feels like the old internet many

1092
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,359
many times by

1093
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,079
fellow users so honestly my advice is

1094
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,560
this

1095
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,119
if you do miss that old internet give

1096
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,320
vrc a try

1097
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,400
i think you'll get it if you spend some

1098
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,839
time with it likewise

1099
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,680
if you don't know what i'm talking about

1100
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,119
and never got to experience that

1101
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,079
firsthand

1102
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,400
well give it a try too and if you do

1103
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,280
like what you see

1104
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,599
know that those of us now entering our

1105
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,320
30s

1106
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,160
are beyond excited for you to get to

1107
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,680
experience what we did for the first

1108
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,240
time

1109
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,680
vrchat is magical it's the absurdity of

1110
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,640
the metaverse

1111
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,359
it's the beauty of the old internet it's

1112
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,119
like hopping into a time machine

1113
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,480
but also going to the future merging

1114
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,520
and i should i'd write a steins gate

1115
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,920
reference

1116
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,200
got the microphone ah

1117
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,359
god man it's gonna be fun lining that

1118
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,400
one up

1119
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,240
so if you're wondering if all of my

1120
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,880
videos presuming there's gonna be

1121
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
more than just this one anyway if you're

1122
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,560
assuming that all of my videos are gonna

1123
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,400
be this cheesy yes

1124
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
the answer is yeah this is all i know i

1125
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,480
this this is what you're gonna get

1126
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,160
there's two things that i think are

1127
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,920
really left that i haven't had a chance

1128
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,640
to get to

1129
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,680
just yet and i kind of want to address

1130
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,640
them before

1131
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,960
closing things out the first thing is

1132
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,640
like what about the other

1133
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,200
vr worlds the other vr programs that

1134
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,880
exist what about them

1135
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,640
obviously vr chat isn't the only one

1136
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,040
that's out there and so

1137
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,720
doesn't everything i just say apply to

1138
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,560
them too now i'm talking about things

1139
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,640
like any land and art space and

1140
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,920
sansar and even something like rec room

1141
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,480
or whatever thing zuckerberg is

1142
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,720
cooking up the thing is they all

1143
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,880
have their merits i'm not going to tell

1144
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,800
you that i don't think that some of them

1145
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,920
are cool too

1146
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,440
the thing is is i think they're

1147
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,680
fundamentally cool for different reasons

1148
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,320
they bring

1149
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,400
something interesting to the table

1150
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,760
sansar really does

1151
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,160
seem for example like it's gonna really

1152
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,960
kill those

1153
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,599
virtual events i shouldn't do that with

1154
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,800
a microphone

1155
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,040
there's also some of the other ones that

1156
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,200
i haven't really mentioned or touched on

1157
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,800
that do things like use bitcoin

1158
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,000
and cryptocurrency to

1159
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,359
make vr better

1160
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,320
and obviously i think that there's neat

1161
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,480
stuff about all of these but they all

1162
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
are kind of coming at the problem

1163
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,400
in a weird way and when i say the

1164
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,599
problem i mean this

1165
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,680
sort of thing that i think vr chat is so

1166
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,040
good at which is

1167
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,520
creating communities i think when you

1168
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,240
look at it

1169
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,480
all of these places are sort of trying

1170
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,320
to create a community from

1171
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,599
the ground up in a very manufactured

1172
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,720
sort of way

1173
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,040
like to look at it in a different light

1174
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,079
vr chat

1175
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,320
basically the developers of vr chat they

1176
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,880
never intended for things to be this way

1177
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,400
i mean like i said that early on

1178
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
when vr chat was started the developers

1179
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,560
never said let's get a bunch of weebs

1180
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,839
together

1181
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,119
and create paradise for them

1182
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,760
they basically just created a program

1183
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,800
and

1184
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,440
fertilized it and just said okay

1185
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,280
whatever community appears we'll do our

1186
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,359
best to nourish and that's exactly what

1187
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,280
they did it's what has basically

1188
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,920
happened

1189
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,640
when a bunch of weebs did come along and

1190
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,680
it became

1191
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,440
you know de facto for everyone to have

1192
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,800
anime avatars or

1193
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,040
whatever they just kind of went with it

1194
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,359
and they did a fantastic job of taking

1195
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,240
that community

1196
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,560
that was naturally occurring in their

1197
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,280
app and

1198
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,960
making sure that it had somewhere to

1199
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,359
grow they never intended from day one to

1200
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,480
build that community

1201
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,119
but when it did appear they made sure

1202
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,000
that they

1203
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,079
supported it you can kind of draw a

1204
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,040
parallel to

1205
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,480
here is actually esports

1206
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,040
strangely enough if you look at a lot of

1207
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,800
games these days they're kind of

1208
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,720
built from the ground up with this idea

1209
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,240
that we're going to

1210
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,640
invent an esport basically every game

1211
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,000
that comes out they talk about

1212
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,480
tournaments and whatnot when in reality

1213
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,280
the best and most successful games in

1214
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,720
that particular field

1215
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,640
kind of happen organically and a lot of

1216
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
the times when you just try to build

1217
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,160
something from the ground up to

1218
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,520
be a certain way well it just doesn't

1219
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,400
work

1220
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,560
man who would be a fan of an astroturf

1221
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,800
esports league

1222
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,839
oh [ __ ] the most successful esports were

1223
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:02,640
organic

1224
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,880
counter-strike for example that

1225
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,920
basically was

1226
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,040
a slow build over 20 years valve

1227
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
never thought it would turn into what it

1228
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,960
did but you kind of see where that's

1229
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,760
gone

1230
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,160
really that's what i see for many of

1231
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,599
these competitors

1232
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,359
like sansar which i was talking about

1233
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,200
before they really want to be

1234
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,119
the virtual nightclub space but like i

1235
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,280
showed you that kind of exists in vr

1236
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,920
chat

1237
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,079
and there's a thriving community there

1238
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,599
i've been to many

1239
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,319
vr raves which is not something i

1240
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,520
thought i would ever

1241
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,640
say look at me do i look like the kind

1242
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,800
of person that goes to a rave

1243
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,520
regardless vr chat kind of has that

1244
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,960
special thing which

1245
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,280
they they found a community and they ran

1246
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
with it that's just not something you

1247
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,720
see nowadays

1248
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,800
everything that's built like that reddit

1249
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,079
quote said from earlier

1250
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,640
is planned from the very beginning it's

1251
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,400
we're gonna put this community

1252
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,240
in this app that we're making this app

1253
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,520
for this community and

1254
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,359
it makes sense why things are that way

1255
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,960
i'm not saying that they

1256
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,440
shouldn't be it's just that i think that

1257
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,760
is one of the things that makes vr chat

1258
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,960
magical

1259
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,200
i also just think and this is kind of

1260
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,119
smaller part of that is that most of

1261
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,240
those spaces

1262
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,440
have been sort of sanitized and i always

1263
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,160
feel bad

1264
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,760
saying that because i don't necessarily

1265
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,560
think that moderation is a bad thing

1266
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,200
but yeah for all space it's very clearly

1267
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,440
supposed to be something a tad bit more

1268
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,000
corporate

1269
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,119
and yeah to lead into whatever crazy

1270
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,200
contraption zuckerberg is creating

1271
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,760
i don't i don't know i don't know i

1272
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,480
don't know

1273
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,960
realistically it's gonna be bad and the

1274
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,160
reason it's gonna be bad

1275
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,560
well just go back and watch that section

1276
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,800
about there

1277
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,240
oh i gotta fix my anime cat over here

1278
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,359
oh oh good enough

1279
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,400
good enough now to the bigger one

1280
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,800
it's monetization we have to look at the

1281
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,160
fact that vrchat

1282
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,040
realistically needs to make money

1283
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,599
currently

1284
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,160
vr chat is basically sustained by

1285
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,960
investor funds

1286
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,760
now investor funds are great they

1287
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,440
basically let you build a team and let

1288
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,040
you build the thing that you want to

1289
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,520
build

1290
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,240
without having to worry too much about

1291
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,760
anything other than building it

1292
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,920
but eventually those investors are going

1293
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,440
to want their money back

1294
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,800
and they're going to want to see a

1295
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
profit and this is where

1296
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,680
many people get kind of antsy about vr

1297
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,160
chat

1298
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,480
most of the things in the video that we

1299
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,760
just talked about

1300
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,960
went from good to

1301
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,280
bad because of monetization

1302
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,560
this is the literal billion dollar

1303
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,440
question which is how do you manage to

1304
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,359
sustain a platform

1305
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,560
while keeping the feel of the platform

1306
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,119
and to be perfectly honest much bigger

1307
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,119
programs much bigger things

1308
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,440
and communities than vr chat have

1309
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:13,839
totally failed at this

1310
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,599
[Music]

1311
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,720
i honestly don't know what the answer to

1312
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,680
monetization

1313
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,000
is and i'm not going to try and guess at

1314
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,440
what it could be

1315
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,079
what i am going to say is that there's

1316
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,240
almost no doubt that no matter what they

1317
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,599
decide to do

1318
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,319
it's going to fundamentally just change

1319
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,839
the platform

1320
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,040
you can't basically had a price tag on

1321
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,800
something and expect it to remain the

1322
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,599
same

1323
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,599
but there's gonna have to be one

1324
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,800
eventually

1325
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,119
having met many of the people on the vr

1326
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:45,920
chat team

1327
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,319
i believe at the very least they are

1328
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,400
going to try their best but

1329
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,880
who can say i can't sit here and tell

1330
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,000
you that they're going to come

1331
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,880
out with some magical solution that is

1332
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,040
going to allow vr chat to stay

1333
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,319
as it is today forever and

1334
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,960
that's kind of why i made this video to

1335
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,480
be perfectly honest

1336
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,960
i don't know if vr chat's going to stay

1337
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,000
the same forever

1338
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,040
so this is what i'll leave you with vr

1339
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,440
chat

1340
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,800
is magical it combines ideas from

1341
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,640
decades ago with the pizzazz of the

1342
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,040
2000s

1343
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,079
with technology that never existed

1344
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,119
really at least not to most people like

1345
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,839
five years ago five ten years ago with

1346
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,680
the advent of virtual reality

1347
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,319
or mainstream virtual reality and even

1348
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,400
if you don't have virtual reality even

1349
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,560
if you like take the virtual reality bit

1350
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,760
and

1351
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,079
put it over there or something just the

1352
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,400
the freedom to create and create in a

1353
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,000
meaningful place and

1354
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,240
with the amount of power that unity

1355
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,160
through vr chat gives you

1356
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,200
is just it's amazing it's a magical

1357
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,680
place

1358
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,319
that is not just the creativity that

1359
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,359
spawns within it

1360
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,440
but is the community that essentially

1361
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,960
puts all these things together

1362
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,160
and does stuff with them however like i

1363
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,960
hinted at

1364
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,280
i'm not quite sure that it's going to be

1365
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,119
this way forever i hope

1366
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,760
that the developers are able to maintain

1367
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,280
this sense of wonderment

1368
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,400
that it just bestows upon me but

1369
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,880
in the case that it doesn't i would

1370
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,920
really like to

1371
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,079
invite other people to experience the

1372
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:22,960
same thing

1373
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,480
that i have experienced and so with that

1374
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,160
if do you have the time go download vr

1375
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,680
chat give it a whirl hop

1376
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,960
in you like me might not get it at first

1377
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,800
you might end up walking around and

1378
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,200
saying

1379
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,599
this isn't for me and maybe in a couple

1380
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,440
months you'll get the bug

1381
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,599
like i did and come back and just be

1382
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,200
blown away

1383
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,720
regardless thank you for watching

1384
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,000
this was a fun journey maybe

1385
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,440
i'll make another one

1386
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,839
goodbye

1387
