Proof of concept: using ImageDownLoader and StringDownLoader to create the most optimized display world possible.

Update 2023.03.02 : 82 paintings.

The Quests see the paintings reversed, correction in progress.

2023.03.04 : Big problem with the ImageDownloader:
When Unity is in play mode, it destroys the texture that was initially in the material, and there is no way to go back once out of play mode. As a result, having a base resolution texture as a teasing is impossible.
